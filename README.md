# IODynamixel

Library to control Dynamixel motors vÃ­a *creature* scheme.

## Setting up the USB port

This library was tested with the *U2D2* controller (*Robotis*). In order to reach good update frequencies, it is necesary to reduce the latency delay, as follows:

``` bash
$ sudo su
# echo 1 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer
# exit
```

## Testing

``` python
from IODynamixel import IODynamixel
dxl = IODynamixel.IODynamixel(json_file="IODynamixel/creatures/poppy_torso.json", freq=40)
dxl.start()
dxl.enableTorque(dxl.get_motor_names())
y = dxl.loadMovement('IODynamixel/movements/saludo.json')
dxl.playMovementBlock(y)
```
